# LLM Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all the prompts used with various LLM tools during the development of the Torre People Search application.

## Tool: Cursor
Model: Claude Sonnet 4

### 1. Initial Project Setup
**Prompt**: "I need to create a full-stack Next.js application for a technical test. The app should search for people using Torre's API and display results with analytics. Please help me set up the project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary dependencies."

### 2. API Integration
**Prompt**: "Create a TypeScript API client for Torre's search endpoints. The client should handle the search API and genome API with proper error handling and TypeScript interfaces."

### 3. Component Development
**Prompt**: "Create a React component for displaying person cards with their information, skills, and experience. Include proper TypeScript types and responsive design with Tailwind CSS."

### 4. Analytics Implementation
**Prompt**: "Implement analytics functions to analyze skills and locations from search results. Create utility functions for skill analysis, location analysis, and experience level detection."

### 5. Chart Component
**Prompt**: "Create a React component using Recharts to display analytics data. The component should show bar charts for skills and locations with proper TypeScript types."

### 6. Main Page Layout
**Prompt**: "Create the main page component that brings together search functionality, results display, and analytics. Include proper state management and user interactions."

### 7. Static HTML Version
**Prompt**: "Create a standalone HTML version of the application that can run without Node.js. Include all necessary CDN links and vanilla JavaScript implementation."

### 8. Documentation
**Prompt**: "Create comprehensive README and setup documentation for the project. Include installation instructions, feature descriptions, and deployment options."

## Tool: ChatGPT
Model: GPT-4

### 1. Error Handling
**Prompt**: "I'm getting CORS errors when making requests to Torre's API from the browser. How can I handle this properly in a Next.js application?"

### 2. Performance Optimization
**Prompt**: "What are the best practices for optimizing a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for production deployment?"

### 3. Accessibility
**Prompt**: "How can I improve the accessibility of my React components, especially for screen readers and keyboard navigation?"

## Tool: GitHub Copilot
Model: GitHub Copilot

### 1. TypeScript Types
**Prompt**: "Generate TypeScript interfaces for Torre API responses including person data, skills, experience, and education."

### 2. Utility Functions
**Prompt**: "Create utility functions for calculating experience levels and skill matches between people."

### 3. CSS Classes
**Prompt**: "Generate Tailwind CSS classes for responsive card layouts and modern UI components."

## Development Process Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Used Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React development
- Implemented TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Chose Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Selected Recharts for data visualization
- Used Axios for HTTP requests with proper error handling

### Code Quality
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces
- Used functional components with hooks
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Included loading states and user feedback
- Followed accessibility best practices

### Performance Considerations
- Implemented proper loading states
- Used Next.js optimization features
- Added error boundaries
- Optimized bundle size with proper imports

### User Experience
- Clean, modern UI design
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Intuitive search functionality
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Comprehensive error messages

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Integration**: Torre's API requires proper CORS handling and error management
2. **TypeScript**: Strong typing significantly improves development experience and reduces bugs
3. **Component Architecture**: Modular components make the codebase maintainable and reusable
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling improves user experience significantly
5. **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent optimization out of the box

## Future Improvements

1. Add more advanced analytics features
2. Implement caching for API responses
3. Add unit tests for components and utilities
4. Implement more sophisticated search filters
5. Add dark mode support
6. Implement real-time search suggestions
